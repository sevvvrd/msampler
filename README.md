# msampler

V 1

-msampler is a simple media downloader with music production in mind. It uses the yt-dlp(YoutubeDL) and pytube(YouTube) libraries to handle downloading.

-other libraries: os, random, pandas, urllib.parse(urlparse).

-this is only meant as a simple tool but if you want to improve it or modify it in any way, please feel free to do so. This program is open source :)

V 1.2

-Code optimisation and bug fixing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V 1.3

-New system to handle downloading. Still using Yt-Dlp and Pytube (for the m4a fix version not default)

-2 Versions are now available instead of 1 (default and m4a fix version)

-Not stable as of now (crashes at launch on some computers, looking into it)

-Using onedir instead of onefile when compiling (Pyinstaller)-(Might be the reason of the crashes)

-Faster startup time since onedir compiling instead of onefile (from ～3s to ~≤1s)
