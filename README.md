# msampler
-msampler is a simple media downloader with music production in mind. It uses the yt-dlp(YoutubeDL) and pytube(YouTube) libraries to handle downloading.

-other libraries: os, random, pandas, urllib.parse(urlparse).

-this is only meant as a simple tool but if you want to improve it or modify it in any way, just send me a dm on discord (sevrd#6382) and i'll send you the source code!
